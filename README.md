# Transformers for Modeling Long-Term Dependencies in Time Series Data

This repository provides a comprehensive review of how transformers are used to model long-term dependencies in time series data, focusing on a variety of domains such as healthcare, finance, and climate. We curate and analyze relevant papers in this field, providing a detailed comparison of the methods used. The abstract of this work will be presented as a poster at the 2023 IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium.
